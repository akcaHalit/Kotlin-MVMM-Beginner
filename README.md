# Kotlin MVMM for Beginners


> 1- At first, we created the project and set the activity_main.xml

> 2- We must set the Data Binding to use MVMM structure.
Basically, it is to send data to the design area. It provides ease for design and class management with less coding.

> Enable data binding in build.gradle.kts:
```
# in build.gradle.kts
 #android { ...
 buildFeatures{
        dataBinding = true
 }
 #... Â }
```
> Change your xml file:
```
<layout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

# Your xml codes...
</layout>
```
> Now, data binding is ready to use.
